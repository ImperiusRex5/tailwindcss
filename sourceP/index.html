            This short paper will cover the most common inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s Disease, and its effects on the human body and homeostasis, the causes of the disease and the possible treatments or cures for it.

            For being such a common form of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), you’d think that there would be information on the cause, but surprisingly enough there isn't. Researchers have many different ideas on what causes Crohn’s disease, the most widely known idea is that Crohn’s disease is the result of an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the immune system attacks its healthy cells, for Crohn’s disease researchers think it may be the autoimmune reaction of the digestive tract that causes Crohn’s. Other common ideas for the cause is that it is a genetic disease that could run in families, as there are genes involved in the immune system function that can malfunction and produce the autoimmune disorder that causes the disease. Other possible causes include a high fat diet, certain medicines like antibiotics and birth-control pills and smoking. Even though there aren’t many direct correlations to the cause of Crohn's, all of the possible causes can start the disease.
